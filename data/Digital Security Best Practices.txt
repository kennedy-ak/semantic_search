Cybersecurity protects digital systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks and unauthorized access. As our reliance on digital technology grows, understanding cybersecurity principles becomes increasingly important for individuals and organizations.
Common threats include malware, phishing attacks, ransomware, and social engineering. Malware encompasses viruses, trojans, and spyware that can steal data or damage systems. Phishing attacks trick users into revealing sensitive information through fake emails or websites. Ransomware encrypts files and demands payment for decryption keys.
Defense strategies include using strong, unique passwords for different accounts, enabling two-factor authentication, keeping software updated, and being cautious with email attachments and links. Regular data backups protect against data loss, while firewalls and antivirus software provide additional protection layers. Employee training is crucial for organizations to prevent human error-based security breaches.
