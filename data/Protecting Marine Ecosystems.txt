Ocean conservation is critical for maintaining biodiversity, supporting fisheries, and regulating global climate. Oceans cover 71% of Earth's surface and contain 97% of the planet's water, playing vital roles in weather patterns, carbon storage, and supporting marine life.
Major threats to ocean health include pollution, overfishing, climate change, and habitat destruction. Plastic pollution harms marine animals through ingestion and entanglement, while chemical runoff creates dead zones with insufficient oxygen. Overfishing depletes fish stocks and disrupts marine food chains. Ocean acidification from increased carbon dioxide levels threatens coral reefs and shellfish.
Conservation efforts include establishing marine protected areas, reducing plastic use, implementing sustainable fishing practices, and addressing climate change. Individual actions like choosing sustainable seafood, reducing plastic consumption, and supporting conservation organizations contribute to ocean protection. International cooperation through treaties and agreements helps coordinate global conservation efforts.
