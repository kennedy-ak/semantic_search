Blockchain technology creates secure, transparent, and decentralized records of transactions across multiple computers. Each block contains transaction data, timestamps, and cryptographic hashes linking it to previous blocks, creating an immutable chain of records.
Key features include decentralization (no single point of control), transparency (all participants can view transactions), immutability (records cannot be altered without consensus), and security (cryptographic protection against fraud). Consensus mechanisms like proof-of-work and proof-of-stake validate new transactions and maintain network integrity.
Applications extend beyond cryptocurrencies to supply chain management, digital identity verification, smart contracts, and voting systems. Smart contracts automatically execute agreements when predetermined conditions are met, reducing need for intermediaries. However, challenges include energy consumption, scalability limitations, and regulatory uncertainty in many jurisdictions.
