Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in fundamentally different ways than classical computers. While classical computers use bits that exist in either 0 or 1 states, quantum computers use quantum bits or "qubits" that can exist in superposition states of both 0 and 1 simultaneously.
Key quantum phenomena include superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference. Superposition allows qubits to be in multiple states simultaneously, enabling parallel computation. Entanglement creates strong correlations between qubits, allowing instantaneous communication of information. Quantum interference helps amplify correct answers while canceling out wrong ones.
Quantum computers excel at specific problems like cryptography, optimization, and molecular simulation. However, they face challenges including quantum decoherence, error rates, and the need for extremely low temperatures. Major companies like IBM, Google, and Microsoft are racing to develop practical quantum computers.
