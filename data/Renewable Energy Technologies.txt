Renewable energy comes from natural sources that are constantly replenished, including solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass. These technologies are crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving energy independence.
Solar energy harnesses sunlight through photovoltaic panels or concentrated solar power systems. Wind energy uses turbines to convert wind motion into electricity. Hydroelectric power generates electricity from flowing water, while geothermal energy taps into Earth's internal heat. Biomass energy comes from organic materials like wood, agricultural residues, and algae.
The renewable energy sector has experienced rapid growth due to declining costs, technological improvements, and supportive government policies. Energy storage solutions like lithium-ion batteries and pumped hydro storage are addressing the intermittency challenges of solar and wind power. Smart grids are enabling better integration of renewable sources into existing power systems.
