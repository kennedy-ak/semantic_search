Cognitive psychology studies mental processes including perception, attention, memory, and decision-making. Understanding these processes helps explain how people learn, solve problems, and interact with their environment.
Memory involves three stages: encoding, storage, and retrieval. Sensory memory briefly holds incoming information, working memory processes current thoughts, and long-term memory stores information permanently. Factors affecting memory include attention, repetition, emotional significance, and context. Memory errors can occur through interference, decay, and reconstruction during retrieval.
Attention is selective and limited, filtering important information while ignoring distractions. Cognitive biases systematically affect decision-making, including confirmation bias (seeking information that confirms existing beliefs) and availability bias (overestimating the probability of memorable events). Understanding these biases helps improve critical thinking and decision-making skills.
