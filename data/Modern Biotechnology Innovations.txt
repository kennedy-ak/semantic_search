Biotechnology uses biological systems, organisms, or derivatives to develop products and technologies that improve human life and health. This interdisciplinary field combines biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, and computer science to create innovative solutions.
Medical biotechnology has produced life-saving treatments including insulin for diabetes, vaccines for infectious diseases, and gene therapies for genetic disorders. Monoclonal antibodies treat various cancers and autoimmune diseases. CRISPR gene editing technology offers potential cures for genetic diseases by precisely modifying DNA sequences.
Agricultural biotechnology develops crops with improved yields, nutritional content, and resistance to pests and diseases. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can address food security challenges and reduce pesticide use. Industrial biotechnology produces biofuels, biodegradable plastics, and specialty chemicals using biological processes that are often more environmentally friendly than traditional methods.
