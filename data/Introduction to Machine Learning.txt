Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. The core concept revolves around algorithms that can identify patterns in data and make predictions or classifications based on these patterns.
There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping function from inputs to outputs. Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. Reinforcement learning learns through interaction with an environment using rewards and penalties.
Popular algorithms include linear regression for predicting continuous values, decision trees for classification tasks, neural networks for complex pattern recognition, and clustering algorithms like k-means for grouping similar data points. The choice of algorithm depends on the problem type, data size, and desired accuracy.
