Space exploration began during the Cold War with the launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union in 1957, marking the start of the Space Age. This achievement sparked the Space Race between the United States and Soviet Union, leading to rapid advancements in rocket technology and astronautics.
Major milestones include Yuri Gagarin becoming the first human in space in 1961, the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969, and the development of space stations like Mir and the International Space Station. Robotic missions have explored every planet in our solar system, with notable successes including the Voyager probes, Mars rovers, and the Hubble Space Telescope.
Modern space exploration involves international cooperation and private companies. SpaceX has revolutionized rocket design with reusable boosters, while NASA's Artemis program aims to return humans to the Moon. Future missions target Mars colonization, asteroid mining, and the search for extraterrestrial life.
