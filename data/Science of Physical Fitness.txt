Exercise physiology studies how the body responds and adapts to physical activity. Regular exercise provides numerous health benefits including improved cardiovascular health, stronger muscles and bones, better mental health, and increased longevity.
Cardiovascular exercise strengthens the heart and improves circulation, reducing risk of heart disease and stroke. Resistance training builds muscle mass and bone density, particularly important for aging populations. Flexibility exercises maintain joint range of motion and reduce injury risk. Balance training becomes increasingly important with age to prevent falls.
The body adapts to exercise through various mechanisms including increased heart efficiency, enhanced oxygen delivery to muscles, and improved metabolic processes. Recovery is crucial for adaptation, requiring adequate sleep, nutrition, and rest between training sessions. Progressive overload gradually increases exercise intensity to continue improvement while avoiding overtraining and injury.
