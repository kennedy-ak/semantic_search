Photography began in the early 19th century with camera obscura principles and light-sensitive materials. The first permanent photograph was created by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in 1826, requiring an eight-hour exposure. Louis Daguerre later developed the daguerreotype process, creating detailed images on silver-plated copper sheets.
The invention of film photography by George Eastman made photography accessible to the general public. His Kodak camera came with the slogan "You press the button, we do the rest." Color photography emerged in the early 20th century, though black and white remained dominant for decades due to cost and technical limitations.
Digital photography revolutionized the field in the late 20th century, eliminating film processing and enabling instant image review. Smartphone cameras have democratized photography further, with advanced computational photography features. Modern trends include HDR imaging, portrait mode, and AI-enhanced photography that rivals traditional camera systems.
