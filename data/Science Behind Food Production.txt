Food science applies chemistry, biology, and engineering principles to understand food composition, processing, preservation, and safety. This knowledge helps develop new products, improve nutritional value, and ensure food safety throughout the supply chain.
Food preservation methods include thermal processing (heating to destroy harmful microorganisms), dehydration (removing water to prevent spoilage), freezing (slowing biochemical reactions), and chemical preservation (using additives to extend shelf life). Modern techniques include irradiation, high-pressure processing, and modified atmosphere packaging.
Food additives serve various functions including preservation, flavor enhancement, color improvement, and texture modification. Natural and artificial flavors create appealing tastes, while emulsifiers help mix oil and water-based ingredients. Food safety regulations ensure additives are thoroughly tested and used in safe quantities. Understanding food labels helps consumers make informed choices about their diet and nutrition.
