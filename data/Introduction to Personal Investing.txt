Investing involves putting money into financial instruments with the expectation of generating returns over time. The fundamental principle is balancing risk and reward while considering your financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance.
Major asset classes include stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Stocks represent ownership in companies and typically offer higher long-term returns but with greater volatility. Bonds are loans to governments or corporations that provide steady income with lower risk. Real estate can provide rental income and appreciation potential. Commodities like gold serve as inflation hedges.
Diversification reduces risk by spreading investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographic regions. Dollar-cost averaging involves investing fixed amounts regularly regardless of market conditions, reducing the impact of market timing. Index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer low-cost diversification options for beginning investors.
