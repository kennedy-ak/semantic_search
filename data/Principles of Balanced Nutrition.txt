Proper nutrition is fundamental to maintaining good health and preventing chronic diseases. A balanced diet should include appropriate proportions of macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals).
Carbohydrates provide energy and should come primarily from whole grains, fruits, and vegetables rather than refined sugars. Proteins are essential for tissue repair and muscle building, found in lean meats, fish, legumes, and dairy products. Healthy fats from sources like nuts, olive oil, and avocados support brain function and hormone production.
Fruits and vegetables provide essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that protect against disease. The recommended intake is at least five servings per day, emphasizing variety and color. Hydration is equally important, with water being the best choice for most people. Limiting processed foods, excessive sodium, and added sugars contributes to better long-term health outcomes.
