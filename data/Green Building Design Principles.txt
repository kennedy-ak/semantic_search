Sustainable architecture integrates environmental considerations throughout the building design, construction, and operation phases. Green buildings minimize environmental impact while providing healthy, comfortable spaces for occupants.
Energy efficiency strategies include proper insulation, high-performance windows, LED lighting, and renewable energy systems like solar panels. Water conservation features include low-flow fixtures, greywater recycling systems, and rainwater harvesting. Sustainable materials selection emphasizes recycled content, local sourcing, and low environmental impact production methods.
Passive design techniques optimize natural lighting, ventilation, and heating through building orientation, window placement, and thermal mass. Green roofs and walls provide insulation, manage stormwater, and improve air quality. Certification programs like LEED and ENERGY STAR help standardize and recognize sustainable building practices.
